## Photosynthesis & Cellular Respiration - A web guide

This web guide was created as a project for an assessment in my AP Biology Course.

It was developed completely on a school Chromebook. Zero source control was used, zero libraries were used, and zero frameworks were used in the
development of this project. There aren't any externally linked JavaScript files or CSS files. Everything was written in one singular html document.

It's important to note that this web guide does not yet function well on tablets or mobile devices. At the time of writing this README doc, the project 
is due in 4 hours. Mobile and tablet support will be added later.
